## Motivation

Soil moisture is a critical parameter for agriculture, landscaping, and environmental monitoring. Through RSMM, the goal is to:

- **Reduce water wastage** by knowing exactly when irrigation is needed.  
- **Improve crop yield and health** by ensuring optimal moisture levels.  
- **Enable remote monitoring** to help farmers or caretakers who are not on-site.  
- **Support data-driven decision making** via visualization and historical analysis.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- Data ingestion from soil moisture sensors.  
- Basic visualization of moisture data (plots, Jupyter notebooks).  
- Raw data storage and early processing pipelines.  

### ðŸ”® Planned
- Real-time dashboards or web UI.  
- Alerts/notifications when moisture drops below thresholds.  
- Integration with weather data to refine irrigation schedules.  
- Support for multiple sensor types and locations.  
- Deployment automation and scaling options.

## Architecture

A high-level overview of the workflow:


- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensors deployed in field.  
- **Data collection**: Scripts or hardware reading sensor values periodically.  
- **Storage**: Local or cloud-based storage for raw and processed data.  
- **Processing**: Data cleaning, aggregation, and thresholding.  
- **Visualization & Alerts**: Dashboards, plots, and notifications.
